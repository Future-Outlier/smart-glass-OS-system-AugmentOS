# WiFi Password Storage Feature

## Overview

The WiFi password storage feature allows users to save and auto-fill WiFi credentials for previously connected networks. This enhances user experience by eliminating the need to re-enter passwords for known networks.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **WifiCredentialsService** (`src/utils/WifiCredentialsService.ts`)
   - Secure storage using MMKV
   - Manages WiFi credentials with metadata
   - Provides methods for saving, retrieving, and managing credentials
   - Limits storage to 50 credentials to prevent unlimited growth

2. **Enhanced WiFi Scan Screen** (`src/app/pairing/glasseswifisetup/scan.tsx`)
   - Shows saved networks with visual indicators
   - Different styling for saved vs. new networks
   - Key icon (ðŸ”‘) for saved networks

3. **Enhanced Password Screen** (`src/app/pairing/glasseswifisetup/password.tsx`)
   - Auto-fills saved passwords
   - "Remember Password" toggle
   - Visual feedback when password is loaded from storage

4. **Enhanced Connecting Screen** (`src/app/pairing/glasseswifisetup/connecting.tsx`)
   - Automatically saves credentials on successful connection
   - Updates last connected timestamp

5. **WifiCredentialsManager** (`src/utils/WifiCredentialsManager.tsx`)
   - Settings component for managing saved networks
   - View, remove, and clear saved networks
   - Shows last connected dates

### Security Features

- **Secure Storage**: Uses MMKV for encrypted storage
- **Limited Storage**: Maximum 50 saved credentials
- **User Control**: Toggle to enable/disable password saving
- **Easy Removal**: Users can remove individual networks or clear all

### User Experience

1. **Auto-Fill**: When selecting a saved network, password is automatically filled
2. **Visual Indicators**: Saved networks show with different styling and key icon
3. **Remember Toggle**: Users can choose whether to save passwords
4. **Management**: Settings screen to view and manage saved networks

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface WifiCredential {
  ssid: string
  password: string
  lastConnected?: number
  autoConnect?: boolean
}

interface WifiCredentialsData {
  credentials: WifiCredential[]
  version: string
}
```

### Key Methods

- `saveCredentials(ssid, password, autoConnect)`: Save new credentials
- `getPassword(ssid)`: Retrieve password for specific network
- `hasCredentials(ssid)`: Check if network is saved
- `removeCredentials(ssid)`: Remove specific network
- `clearAllCredentials()`: Remove all saved networks
- `updateLastConnected(ssid)`: Update connection timestamp
- `getRecentNetworks()`: Get networks connected in last 30 days

## Usage

### For Users

1. **First Connection**: Enter password and enable "Remember Password"
2. **Subsequent Connections**: Password auto-fills, just tap connect
3. **Management**: Go to Settings to view/remove saved networks

### For Developers

```typescript
import WifiCredentialsService from "@/utils/WifiCredentialsService"

// Save credentials
await WifiCredentialsService.saveCredentials("MyWiFi", "password123", true)

// Get saved password
const password = WifiCredentialsService.getPassword("MyWiFi")

// Check if network is saved
const isSaved = WifiCredentialsService.hasCredentials("MyWiFi")
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-Connect**: Automatically connect to saved networks when in range
2. **Network Prioritization**: Prioritize networks based on usage patterns
3. **Export/Import**: Allow users to backup/restore saved networks
4. **Network Categories**: Organize networks (Home, Work, Public, etc.)
5. **Security Enhancements**: Additional encryption layers if needed

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Error handling for storage operations
- Graceful fallbacks when storage fails
- Input validation and sanitization
- User-friendly error messages

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are stored locally using MMKV encryption
- No passwords are transmitted to external servers
- Users have full control over saved credentials
- Easy removal of all saved data
- Limited storage prevents excessive data accumulation
