Now that you've made a MentraOS app, it's time to deploy. A MentraOS app is just a regular web app, so you can deploy it anywhere. We recommend using **Railway** for deployment. You can also deploy on an Ubuntu cloud server.

## Deployment Options

Choose your preferred deployment method:

- **[Railway Deployment](/railway-deployment)** - Quick and easy deployment with automatic scaling
- **[Ubuntu Server Deployment](/ubuntu-deployment)** - Self-hosted deployment on an Ubuntu cloud server
