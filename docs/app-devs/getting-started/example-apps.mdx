## Examples for Display Glasses

These examples work with display smart glasses like Even Realities G1 and Vuzix Z100.

**Repository:** [MentraOS-Display-Example-App](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Display-Example-App)

Displays spoken words as live captions on the glasses' HUD. This is the recommended starting point for developers new to MentraOS.

Captures photos using the glasses and view them on their phone.
