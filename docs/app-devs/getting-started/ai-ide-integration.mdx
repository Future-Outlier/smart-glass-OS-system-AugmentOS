<Info>
**TL;DR** - Get your AI coding assistant to understand MentraOS instantly. Works with Zed, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Claude Code, and more.
</Info>

## Why Connect Your AI IDE?

When you connect your AI coding assistant to MentraOS docs, it can:

- Answer questions about the MentraOS SDK
- Help you write smart glasses apps faster
- Look up API references automatically
- Debug your code with context about how MentraOS works

## MCP Server URL

All setups below use this URL:

```
https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp
```

---

## Setup by IDE

### Zed

Add this to your `settings.json` (open with `Cmd+,` or `zed: open settings`):

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "mentraos-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Zed and you're done.

<Accordion title="How to verify it's working">
Open the Agent Panel and check the MCP servers indicator in settings. A green dot means the server is active. You can also type `/` in a chat to see available prompts from the server.
</Accordion>

---

### Cursor

Add this to your Cursor MCP config file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (create it if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentraos-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then **restart Cursor**.

<Accordion title="Alternative: Project-level config">
You can also create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root to enable MentraOS docs only for that project.
</Accordion>

---

### VS Code (with GitHub Copilot)

VS Code 1.99+ has built-in MCP support with GitHub Copilot.

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run **"MCP: Add Server"**
3. Select **"HTTP"** as the transport type
4. Enter URL: `https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp`
5. Name it `mentraos-docs`

<Accordion title="Manual configuration">
Add to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "mentraos-docs": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

---

### Windsurf

1. Open Windsurf Settings (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)
2. Search for "MCP" and click to open the Manage Plugins panel
3. Click **"View raw config"** to open `mcp_config.json`
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentraos-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **Refresh** in the Manage Plugins panel

<Accordion title="Config file location">
- **macOS**: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json`
</Accordion>

---

### Claude Code (CLI)

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add mentraos-docs --transport http https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp
```

<Accordion title="Verify it worked">
Run `claude mcp list` to see your connected servers. You should see `mentraos-docs` in the list.
</Accordion>

---

### Other MCP-Compatible Tools

For any tool that supports MCP, use `mcp-remote` to connect to our HTTP endpoint:

```bash
npx -y mcp-remote https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp
```

Or if your tool supports HTTP MCP servers directly, use the URL:

```
https://docs.mentraglass.com/mcp
```

---

## Test It Out

After setup, try asking your AI assistant:

- *"How do I display text on smart glasses with MentraOS?"*
- *"Show me how to use the camera API"*
- *"What events can I listen to in an AppSession?"*
- *"How do I listen for metric system setting changes?"*

Your AI should now give you accurate, up-to-date answers using our docs.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Server not connecting">
    Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed. The `mcp-remote` package requires it.
    
    ```bash
    node --version  # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="npx command not found">
    Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) which includes npm and npx.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission errors">
    Try running the npx command with `sudo` on macOS/Linux, or run your terminal as Administrator on Windows.
  </Accordion>
