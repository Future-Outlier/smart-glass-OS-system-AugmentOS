# Intro to the MentraOS SDK

## What is MentraOS?

MentraOS is a cloud operating system for smart glasses that handles the hard parts: connections, Bluetooth, streaming, and more. This lets you focus on creating great smart glasses apps.

As a Cloud OS, you can write apps in JavaScript/TypeScript (with Python coming soon) and use our SDK to build for smart glasses. Our SDK enables you to access smart glasses I/O with low latency from a cloud application.
