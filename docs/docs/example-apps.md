# Example Apps

MentraOS provides several example applications to help you get started building for different types of smart glasses. Choose an example based on your device capabilities and use case.

## Examples for HUD-enabled Glasses

These examples work with smart glasses that have a heads-up display (HUD), such as Even Realities G1, Vuzix Z100, and Mentra Mach1.

### Live Captions Example

**Repository:** [MentraOS-Cloud-Example-App](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Cloud-Example-App)

A simple example app that displays spoken words as live captions on the glasses' HUD. This is the recommended starting point for developers new to MentraOS.

**Features:**
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion example
- Display captions on glasses HUD

**Best for:** Getting started with HUD-based applications

### Extended Example (Advanced)

**Repository:** [MentraOS-Extended-Example-App](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Extended-Example-App)

A more comprehensive example that includes additional features beyond the basic live captions functionality.

**Features:**
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion example
- Webview example
- Mira tools example

**Best for:** Developers who have completed the quickstart and want to explore more advanced features

## Examples for Camera-only Glasses

These examples are designed for smart glasses without a HUD but with camera capabilities, such as Mentra Live glasses.

### Camera Example

**Repository:** [MentraOS-Camera-Example-App](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Camera-Example-App)

An example app that demonstrates camera functionality for glasses without a display. Users can capture photos using the glasses and view them on their phone.

**Features:**
- Photo capture from glasses camera with a button press
- Display captured images in the app's webview

**Best for:** Building camera-based applications for non-HUD glasses
