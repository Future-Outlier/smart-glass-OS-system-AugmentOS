# Contributing to MentraOS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MentraOS! This guide will help you understand the project architecture, development workflow, and how to make effective contributions.

## Project Overview

MentraOS is an open-source operating system, app store, and development framework for smart glasses. The system follows a distributed architecture where most processing happens in the cloud, with the glasses primarily acting as input/output devices.

### System Components

1. **Mobile App** (`mobile/`):
   - React Native application for smartphones
   - User interface for managing glasses, apps, and settings
   - Interfaces with native modules on iOS/Android

2. **Android Core** (`android_core/`):
   - Android native module
   - Handles Bluetooth communication with glasses
   - Handles phone/glasses microphone management
   - Handles websocket communications with the cloud
   - Manages glass connections and capabilities

3. **iOS Native Module** (`mobile/ios`):
   - iOS native module
   - Handles Bluetooth communication with glasses
   - Handles phone/glasses microphone management
   - Handles websocket communications with the cloud
   - Manages glass connections and capabilities

4. **Android Smart Glasses Client** (`asg_client/`):
   - Android code that runs on Android-based smart glasses
   - Enables glasses to connect to the MentraOS ecosystem
   - Provides a BLE API for Android-based glasses to connect to the MentraOS Mobile App
   - Can communicate with MentraOS Cloud directly for streaming photos/videos, falls back to BLE for photos when internet is not available

5. **MentraOS Cloud** (`cloud/`):
   - Node.js backend services
   - Manages app sessions, transcription, display, audio playback
   - Handles real-time communication between glasses and apps
   - Controls app lifecycle and display rendering

6. **Mentra Store** (`cloud/store/`):
   - React application for users to discover and install apps
   - Showcases available apps
   - Provides app descriptions (and in the future: screenshots + ratings)
   - Handles app installation

7. **MentraOS Developer Console** (`cloud/developer-portal/`):
   - React application for developers to register and manage apps
   - Provides tools for app submission and updates
   - Includes documentation and SDK resources

8. **MentraOS Apps**:
   - External web servers that connect to MentraOS cloud
   - Use webhooks and websockets for real-time communication
   - Leverage Mentra SDK for display and input handling

## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SG as Smart Glasses
    participant Phone as Phone App
    participant Cloud as MentraOS Cloud
    participant App as Third-Party App

    SG->>Phone: Input (audio, sensors)
    Phone->>Cloud: Forward input data
    Cloud->>App: Send relevant events
    App->>Cloud: Request display update
    Cloud->>Phone: Forward display command
    Phone->>SG: Update display
```

## Third-Party App Architecture

Third-party apps in the MentraOS ecosystem follow a specific pattern:

1. **Webhook Endpoint** - Entry point for starting an app session
2. **WebSocket Connection** - Real-time communication channel
3. **Event Subscriptions** - Listen for specific user events
4. **Display Requests** - Send content to be displayed on glasses

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm/yarn/bun
- Android Studio (for Android development)
