# App Connection State Management Issues

## Overview

During investigation of Azure Speech Recognition infinite retry loops and App stopping issues, we discovered fundamental problems with App connection state management that prevent proper grace period handling and cause inappropriate app resurrection.

## Root Cause: Missing WebSocket Close Event Handlers

### The Problem
App WebSocket connections are stored in `AppManager.handleAppInit()` but **no close event handlers are set up**, meaning:

1. **Grace Period Logic Never Executes**: `handleAppConnectionClosed()` exists but is never called
2. **Immediate Inappropriate Resurrection**: Services detect closed connections and trigger resurrection without any grace period
3. **No State Management**: No tracking of connection states (grace period, resurrecting, etc.)

### Current Broken Flow
```
App WebSocket closes → NO close handler → WebSocket removed from Map eventually
                                      ↓
                    Service tries to send message → sendMessageToApp() detects closed connection
                                      ↓
                    Immediately triggers resurrection (BYPASSES 5-second grace period!)
```

### Expected Flow
```
App WebSocket closes → Close handler fires → Grace period starts (5 seconds)
                                         ↓
                     Natural reconnection OR grace period expires → Allow resurrection
```

## Issue 1: App Apps Cannot Be Stopped

### Problem Description
When users try to stop Apps via the app interface, the apps immediately restart due to automatic resurrection logic.

### Root Cause
The resurrection logic in `AppManager.sendMessageToApp()` cannot distinguish between:
- **Crashed/Disconnected Apps** (should be resurrected)
- **Intentionally Stopped Apps** (should NOT be resurrected)

### Current Conflict
1. User stops App → `AppManager.stopApp()` closes WebSocket
2. Service (e.g., transcription) tries to send data → `sendMessageToApp()` detects closed connection
3. Automatic resurrection triggered → App restarts against user's intent

## Issue 2: Azure Speech Recognition Infinite Retry Loop
(this might have been fixed already, i haven't seen it since.)
### Problem Description
Azure Speech Recognition enters infinite retry loop with error code 7 (SPXERR_INVALID_OPERATION) every ~60 seconds.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **60-Second Pattern**: MicrophoneManager triggers transcription restart every ~60 seconds
2. **Overlapping Streams**: `updateTranscriptionState()` creates new Azure streams without checking if streams already exist
3. **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple active Azure Speech Recognition streams cause error code 7

### Log Pattern
```
[07:24:30.310] ERROR: Recognition canceled with InvalidOperation (error 7)
    streamAge: 60050    ← Stream was running successfully for 60 seconds
[07:24:30.522] INFO: Starting transcription based on microphone state
[07:24:30.952] ERROR: Recognition canceled with InvalidOperation (error 7)
    streamAge: 427      ← New stream fails after only 427ms due to resource conflict
```

## Issue 3: Missing Connection State Management

### Current State (Implicit)
- **RUNNING**: App in `runningApps` + active WebSocket
- **GRACE_PERIOD**: App in `runningApps` + no WebSocket + reconnection timer active
- **DISCONNECTED**: App NOT in `runningApps` + no WebSocket
- **RESURRECTING**: No explicit tracking!

### Problems
1. **No Explicit State Tracking**: Connection states are implicit and scattered
2. **Race Conditions**: Services can trigger resurrection during grace periods
3. **Duplicate Resurrections**: Multiple services can trigger resurrection simultaneously
4. **No Message Queueing Strategy**: Unclear what happens to messages during state transitions

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Missing WebSocket Close Event Handlers

**Location**: `AppManager.handleAppInit()` after line 530

```typescript
// Store the WebSocket connection
this.userSession.appWebsockets.set(packageName, ws);

// Set up close event handler for proper grace period handling
ws.on('close', (code: number, reason: Buffer) => {
  this.handleAppConnectionClosed(packageName, code, reason.toString());
});
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Grace period logic finally gets triggered
- ✅ Immediate detection of connection loss
- ✅ Prevents premature resurrection during natural reconnection window
- ✅ Centralizes connection lifecycle management in AppManager

### Solution 2: Implement Explicit Connection State Management

**Proposed State Enum**:
```typescript
enum AppConnectionState {
  RUNNING = 'running',           // Active WebSocket connection
  GRACE_PERIOD = 'grace_period', // Waiting for natural reconnection (5s)
  RESURRECTING = 'resurrecting', // System actively restarting app
  STOPPING = 'stopping',         // User/system initiated stop in progress
  DISCONNECTED = 'disconnected'  // Available for resurrection
}
```

**State Transitions**:
- User stops app → STOPPING
- WebSocket closes unexpectedly → GRACE_PERIOD (5s timer)
- WebSocket closes while STOPPING → Remove from all states (clean shutdown)
- Grace period expires → DISCONNECTED
- Message fails + state is DISCONNECTED → RESURRECTING
- WebSocket reconnects → RUNNING
- Resurrection fails → DISCONNECTED

**Distinguishing Intentional vs Unintentional Closes**:
```typescript
// User calls stopApp()
async stopApp(packageName: string): Promise<void> {
  // Set to STOPPING state before closing WebSocket
  this.setAppConnectionState(packageName, AppConnectionState.STOPPING);

  // Close WebSocket - this will trigger close handler
  const websocket = this.userSession.appWebsockets.get(packageName);
  if (websocket) {
    websocket.close(1000, 'App stopped by user');
  }
}

// Close handler
handleAppConnectionClosed(packageName: string, code: number, reason: string): void {
  const currentState = this.getAppConnectionState(packageName);

  if (currentState === AppConnectionState.STOPPING) {
    // Expected close - remove from all tracking
    this.logger.info(`App ${packageName} stopped as expected`);
    this.cleanupApp(packageName);
    return;
  }

  // Unexpected close - start grace period
  this.logger.info(`App ${packageName} unexpectedly disconnected, starting grace period`);
  this.setAppConnectionState(packageName, AppConnectionState.GRACE_PERIOD);
  this.startGracePeriod(packageName);
}
```

### Solution 3: Message Handling Strategy by Connection State

**Natural Reconnection (within grace period)**:
- **App Perspective**: Same session continuing, internal state intact
- **Message Handling**: ✅ Queue or "fail gracefully (dropped messages)" - App expects continuity
- **Rationale**: Brief network hiccup, ongoing conversation should continue

**Resurrection (after grace period)**:
- **App Perspective**: Fresh start, new session, internal state reset
- **Message Handling**: ❌ Fail gracefully - old messages don't make sense
- **Rationale**: App was restarted, expects clean slate

**Implementation**:
```typescript
async sendMessageToApp(packageName: string, message: any): Promise<AppMessageResult> {
  const appState = this.getAppConnectionState(packageName);

  if (appState === AppConnectionState.STOPPING) {
    return { sent: false, resurrectionTriggered: false, error: 'App is being stopped' };
  }

  if (appState === AppConnectionState.GRACE_PERIOD) {
    return { sent: false, resurrectionTriggered: false, error: 'Connection lost, waiting for reconnection' };
  }

  if (appState === AppConnectionState.RESURRECTING) {
    return { sent: false, resurrectionTriggered: false, error: 'App is restarting' };
  }

  if (appState === AppConnectionState.DISCONNECTED) {
    // Trigger resurrection but DON'T retry the message
    await this.resurrectApp(packageName); // No message retry
    return { sent: false, resurrectionTriggered: true, error: 'App restarted, message not sent' };
  }

  // Normal sending for RUNNING state...
}
```

### Solution 4: Fix Azure Speech Recognition Overlapping Streams

**Problem**: `MicrophoneManager.updateTranscriptionState()` calls `transcriptionService.startTranscription()` without checking if streams already exist.

**Solution**: Add stream state validation in `updateTranscriptionState()`:
```typescript
private updateTranscriptionState(): void {
  try {
    if (this.enabled) {
      // Check if transcription is already running
      if (!transcriptionService.isTranscriptionActive(this.session)) {
        this.logger.info('Starting transcription based on microphone state');
        transcriptionService.startTranscription(this.session);
      } else {
        this.logger.debug('Transcription already active, skipping start request');
      }
    } else {
      this.logger.info('Stopping transcription based on microphone state');
      transcriptionService.stopTranscription(this.session);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error('Error updating transcription state:', error);
  }
}
```
