## Memory Telemetry and Leak Detection

### What we added
- Periodic memory telemetry with per-session stats
- Finalization-based leak detection hooks
- Admin endpoints to fetch telemetry and trigger a heap snapshot

### Files
- `services/debug/MemoryTelemetryService.ts`: Periodically logs process and session-level memory stats.
- `services/debug/MemoryLeakDetector.ts`: Registers objects with `FinalizationRegistry`, warns when not GC’d soon after disposal.
- `routes/admin.routes.ts`:
  - `GET /api/admin/memory/now` returns a point-in-time telemetry snapshot.
  - `POST /api/admin/memory/heap-snapshot` writes a `.heapsnapshot` to the OS temp directory.
- `index.ts`: Starts the memory telemetry service at boot.

### Session stats schema (subset)
```
{
  timestamp,
  process: { memory, loadavg, uptime },
  sessions: [
    {
      userId,
      audio: { recentBufferChunks, recentBufferBytes, orderedBufferChunks, orderedBufferBytes },
      transcription: { vadBufferChunks, vadBufferBytes, transcriptLanguages, transcriptSegments },
      microphone: { enabled, keepAliveActive },
      apps: { running, websockets }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Leak detection
- We register each `UserSession` on creation and mark it disposed on `dispose()`.
- If it isn’t GC’d within 60s, we log a warning with the session’s tag.
- When GC finalizes, we log an info with the tag and optional disposed timestamp.

### Notes
- Heap snapshots can be opened in Chrome DevTools or `node --inspect` tooling.
- The telemetry intentionally avoids heavy aggregation; it’s designed to be cheap and always-on.
- If you want to tag more objects, call `memoryLeakDetector.register(object, tag)` and `markDisposed(tag)` on cleanup.
