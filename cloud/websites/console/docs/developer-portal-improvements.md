# Developer Portal Improvements

## Introduction
This document outlines the current issues with the MentraOS Developer Portal and proposes solutions to improve the overall user experience, particularly around App (Third-Party App) creation and management.

## Current Issues

### 1. URL Trailing Slash Problem
- When developers enter a server URL with a trailing slash (e.g., "https://example.com/"), it causes issues
- The system appends "/webhook" to these URLs automatically, resulting in invalid URLs like "https://example.com//webhook"
- No URL sanitization is currently implemented

### 2. Insufficient Feedback After App Creation
- Success message appears at the top of the form, requiring users to scroll up to see it
- Users often click "Create" multiple times, not realizing the App was already created
- No toast notifications for successful App creation (unlike other sections of the app)

### 3. API Key Management Issues
- API key dialog opens automatically after creation, but if closed, users lose access to the initial key
- Closing the dialog loses the key since it's not saved (only hashed in the database)
- Requires regenerating the key, which invalidates the original one
- Current regeneration flow is confusing, especially for new developers
- Existing modal shows an empty area where users might expect to see their current key

### 4. Missing Tooltips/Labels on Action Buttons
- The action buttons in the App table lack clear labels or tooltips
- Icons alone don't convey their purpose clearly (API key, Share, Publish, etc.)
- New users struggle to understand what each button does

### 5. Poor Scrolling Experience
- Important feedback is often outside the visible area after form submission
- Success/error states aren't immediately visible to users

### 6. API Key Dialog State Persistence Issue
- When regenerating API keys for multiple Apps in sequence, the dialog incorrectly shows the previously generated API key
- The dialog doesn't properly reset its state between different Apps
- This creates confusion and security risks as users might believe they're seeing the correct API key for the current App

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. URL Sanitization
- Implement URL sanitization to automatically remove trailing slashes
- Add a helper function to normalize URLs before submission
- Apply this to both creation and editing flows

### 2. Improved Feedback System
- Add toast notifications for successful App creation (similar to EditApp.tsx)
- Keep the in-form success message, but make it more visible
- Ensure the success state is visible without requiring scrolling
- Consider auto-scrolling to show success message and next steps

### 3. Enhanced API Key Management
- Create a dedicated success modal that appears after App creation with options to generate an API key
- Make it explicit that the API key needs to be copied immediately, as it cannot be retrieved later
- Clarify in the regeneration modal that generating a new key invalidates any previous keys
- Improve visual design to make it clear that no existing key can be viewed (only regenerated)
- Add helper text explaining the API key process throughout
- Implement a more visible and user-friendly copy button

### 4. Button Labeling and Tooltip Enhancements
- Add tooltips to all action buttons in the App table
- Consider text labels alongside icons for the most important actions
- Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application

### 5. Visual Hierarchy Improvements
- Restructure the success state to be more prominent
- Ensure important feedback is visible in the viewport after form submission
- Consider using color and animation to draw attention to important notices

### 6. Fix API Key Dialog State Management
- Ensure the API key dialog completely resets its state when opened for a different App
- Clear the previous API key from state when the dialog is opened or closed
- Implement improved state management to prevent cross-App data leakage
- Add proper key resets in useEffect hooks to ensure fresh state for each App

## Implementation Plan

### URL Sanitization
- Add a utility function in `utils.ts` to normalize URLs
- Modify form submission in CreateApp.tsx and EditApp.tsx to use this function
- Add unit tests for the URL normalization function

### Toast Notifications
- Verify Toaster component is properly mounted in the application
- Add toast notifications to CreateApp similar to those in EditApp
- Ensure consistent styling and behavior across the application

### API Key Dialog Improvements
- Create a new dedicated success dialog that appears after App creation
- Include API key generation options in this new dialog
- Modify the existing ApiKeyDialog.tsx to improve clarity about key regeneration
- Update the user flow to emphasize the importance of copying the key immediately
- Improve visual design of the API key section in both dialogs

### Button and Tooltip Enhancements
- Add tooltips to action buttons in AppTable.tsx
- Consider adding text labels for clarity
- Ensure consistent styling across the application

### Visual Hierarchy Adjustments
- Restructure the form success state in CreateApp.tsx
- Ensure feedback is visible in the viewport
- Consider auto-scrolling to show success message

### API Key Dialog State Management
- Review and refactor the API key dialog component's state management
- Implement proper state reset logic when the dialog opens for a new App
- Add safeguards to prevent cross-App data leakage
- Ensure the apiKey state is properly cleared and reset between different Apps

## Implementation Checklist
