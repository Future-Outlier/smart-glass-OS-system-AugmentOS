# BLE File Transfer Implementation for K900/Mentra Live Glasses

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of BLE file transfer protocol for sending images from K900/Mentra Live glasses to phone.

## Protocol Documentation (from ODM)

### 1. BLE Service and Characteristics
- **Service UUID**: `00004860-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **File Read UUID**: `000072FF-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (BES ‚Üí Phone)
- **File Write UUID**: `000073FF-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (Phone ‚Üí BES)
- **Normal TX/RX UUIDs**: `000070FF/000071FF`

### 2. File Transfer Protocol Format
```
head(2) + file_type(1) + pack_size(2) + pack_index(2) + file_size(4) + 
file_name(16) + flags(2) + data(n) + verify(1) + tail(2)
```
- **Head**: `##` (0x23, 0x23)
- **File type**: `0x31` for photos
- **Pack size**: 400 bytes per packet (except last)
- **Pack index**: Starting from 0
- **Verify**: Checksum of data bytes (sum & 0xFF)
- **Tail**: `$$` (0x24, 0x24)

### 3. Transfer Flow
1. MTK sends packet to BES via UART
2. BES forwards to phone via BLE
3. Phone sends acknowledgment: `{"C":"cs_flts", "V":1, "B":"{"state": 1, "index": 5}"}`
4. BES forwards ack back to MTK
5. MTK sends next packet

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

1. **K900ProtocolUtils.java** (android_core)
   - Added file transfer constants (CMD_TYPE_PHOTO, etc.)
   - Implemented `packFilePacket()` for creating packets
   - Implemented `extractFilePacket()` for parsing packets
   - Added `createFileTransferAck()` for acknowledgments
   - Created `FilePacketInfo` class

2. **K900BluetoothManager.java** (asg_client)
   - Added `sendImageFile()` method
   - Implemented packet-by-packet transmission
   - Added retry logic with 5 attempts
   - Added `sendTestImageFromAssets()` for testing
   - Tracks transfer state with `FileTransferSession`

3. **MentraLiveSGC.java** (android_core)
   - Added file packet detection in `processReceivedData()`
   - Implemented `FileTransferSession` for reassembly
   - Added `processFilePacket()` method
   - Sends acknowledgments via `sendFileTransferAck()`
   - Saves files to `/MentraLive_Images/`

4. **ComManager.java** (asg_client)
   - Added `sendFile()` method (no logging)
   - Added `setFastMode()` method
   - Updated RecvThread to use 5ms/50ms sleep based on mode

5. **Test Integration**
   - Modified `cs_pho` button handler to send `test.jpg` from assets

### ‚ùå Current Issues

1. **Phone never receives file packets**
   - Glasses send 432-byte packets successfully
   - Phone receives normal messages (battery, ping/pong) fine
   - File packets are never received on any characteristic
   - No acknowledgments sent back
   - Glasses retry 5 times then fail

2. **Characteristics are discovered correctly**
   - All 4 characteristics found (70FF, 71FF, 72FF, 73FF)
   - Notifications enabled on both 70FF and 72FF
   - MTU negotiated to 512 bytes

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Byte order mismatch (FIXED)**
   - **Problem**: Reference implementation uses big-endian for all multi-byte integers in file packets
   - **Our bug**: We were using little-endian byte order
   - **Impact**: BES chip couldn't parse packet structure (pack_size, pack_index, file_size, flags)
   - **Fix**: Updated `packFilePacket` and `extractFilePacket` to use big-endian byte order
   - **Note**: File packets are sent raw without K900 protocol wrapper (confirmed from reference)

## Debugging Findings

### What Works
- Normal JSON messages (< 100 bytes) work perfectly
- Both directions of communication work for small messages
- BLE connection is stable
- MTU negotiation succeeds (512 bytes)
- All characteristics are discovered and monitored

### What Doesn't Work
- 432-byte file packets are sent but never received
- No data arrives on ANY characteristic when file is sent
- BES chip doesn't forward acknowledgments back to MTK

### Logs Analysis

**Glasses (ASG Client)**:
```
D  üéæ TEST: Starting file transfer from assets: test.jpg (6570 bytes, 17 packets)
D  >>> sending 432 bytes
D  Sent file packet 0/16 (400 bytes)
W  Retrying file packet 0 (attempt 1)
W  Retrying file packet 0 (attempt 2)
...
E  File packet 0 failed after 5 retries
```

**Phone (Android Core)**:
- No logs about receiving file packets
- Only receives normal messages during this time

## Recent Fixes

### 1. **Byte Order Fixed** ‚úÖ
- Changed from little-endian to big-endian for all multi-byte integers
- File packets now being received on correct characteristic (72FF)

### 2. **ACK Parsing Enhanced** ‚úÖ  
- Glasses now handle both string and object formats for B field
- Prevents crashes when receiving different ACK formats

### 3. **Debug Logging Added** ‚úÖ
- Better visibility into packet extraction failures
- Shows full packet length and more hex data

## Current Issues  

### 1. **File Transfer Working but Stuck** ‚úÖ‚ùå
- Phone successfully receives packet 0 and sends ACK
- But duplicate detection prevents progress on retries
- Need to fix glasses to handle ACKs properly

### 2. **Phantom ACK Issue** üêõ
- Glasses receive `{"C":"cs_flts","B":{"state":1,"index":1}}` immediately after sending
- Wrong index (1 instead of 0) and arrives too fast to be from phone
- Likely BES chip auto-response or ODM firmware behavior
- Our real ACK arrives later with correct format and index

### 3. **Working Components** ‚úÖ
- File packet extraction now works correctly
- Proper byte order (big-endian) being used
- Phone successfully receives and processes packets
- Full 432-byte packets are received intact
- BES chip auto-acknowledgment system works

## Key Discovery: BES Auto-Acknowledgment

### The ODM Documentation Truth
- ODM docs ONLY describe MTK<=>BES communication
- "Mtk send pack to bes first, when bes receive successfully, bes will reply to mtk"
- Phone is NOT mentioned in the ACK flow
- BES chip automatically handles all acknowledgments

### BES ACK Behavior
- BES sends: `{"C":"cs_flts","B":{"state":1,"index":packet_index+1}}`
- Index is always packet_index + 1 (e.g., index=1 for packet 0)
- ACK arrives immediately because it's from BES, not phone
- This is the REAL ACK, not a phantom

## Implementation Updates

### Glasses Side (K900BluetoothManager)
- Updated to properly handle BES auto-ACKs
- BES sends index = packet_index + 1
- Removed confusion about "phantom" ACKs
- Now correctly progresses through file transfer

### Phone Side (MentraLiveSGC)  
- Disabled phone ACK sending (commented out)
- BES chip handles all acknowledgments
- Phone only receives and processes packets
- File saving functionality remains intact

## Next Steps

1. **Test the updated implementation**
   - Verify file transfer progresses past packet 0
   - Check if complete file is received
   - Confirm BES ACKs are working correctly

2. **Monitor transfer progress**
   - Watch for proper packet sequence
   - Verify all packets are received
   - Check final file integrity

## Key Code Locations

- **Protocol Utils**: `/android_core/.../utils/K900ProtocolUtils.java`
- **Glasses Send**: `/asg_client/.../bluetooth/K900BluetoothManager.java`
- **Phone Receive**: `/android_core/.../smartglassescommunicators/MentraLiveSGC.java`
- **Serial Comm**: `/asg_client/.../bluetooth/serial/ComManager.java`
- **Test Trigger**: `/asg_client/.../AsgClientService.java` (cs_pho handler)

## Test Setup

1. Place `test.jpg` in `/asg_client/app/src/main/assets/`
2. Press photo button on glasses
3. Check logs on both sides

## Important Notes

- File transfer uses same service but might use different characteristics (72FF/73FF)
- Fast mode is critical for acknowledgments to work
- BES chip acts as intermediary between MTK and phone
- Reference implementation uses 400-byte packets but this might be too large for BLE
