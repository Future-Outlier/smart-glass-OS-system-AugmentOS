# Implementation Readiness Check

## What We Have Covered ✓

### 1. Deployment Strategy ✓
- ASG Client v6 bundles OTA Updater v2 in assets
- Automatic deployment on first boot
- Package monitoring for auto-launch

### 2. Update Mechanisms ✓
- OTA Updater can self-update
- Sequential updates (no concurrent downloads)
- Backup creation before all updates
- Support for legacy + new version.json formats

### 3. Recovery Mechanisms ✓
- ASG Client monitors and can redeploy OTA updater
- Both apps maintain backup APKs
- Mutual recovery capabilities maintained

### 4. Architecture Improvements ✓
- Clean separation with OtaUpdaterManager
- Documented Activity vs Service issues
- Plan for future FGS migration

## Potential Gaps to Consider

### 1. Error Handling
- What happens if download fails mid-way?
- What if installation broadcast fails?
- Should we add more detailed error telemetry?

### 2. Version.json Transition
- How long do we support legacy format?
- Should we version the version.json format itself?
- Fallback URL if primary version.json is unreachable?

### 3. Testing Scenarios
- Device with very low storage space
- Device with corrupted /storage/emulated/0/asg/ directory
- Race condition between manual app uninstall and auto-recovery
- What if user manually updates via other means?

### 4. Monitoring
- How do we know deployment succeeded across 400 devices?
- Should we add analytics/telemetry?
- Success rate tracking?

### 5. Rollback Plan
- If v2 has critical bug, how do we rollback?
- Can we remotely disable v2 and revert to v1?
- Emergency kill switch?

## Recommendations Before Implementation

1. **Add Basic Telemetry**
   - Simple HTTP ping on successful update
   - Error reporting for failures
   - Device count for deployment tracking

2. **Add Storage Space Check**
   - Before extracting from assets
   - Before downloading updates
   - Cleanup old APK files

3. **Add Emergency Flags to version.json**
   ```json
   {
     "emergencyFlags": {
       "disableOtaUpdaterSelfUpdate": false,
       "forceVersion": null
     },
     "apps": {...}
   }
   ```

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Kill app during download
   - Kill app during installation
   - Fill up storage
   - Corrupt backup APKs

## Final Assessment

**Ready to implement?** YES, with these considerations:

1. The core plan is solid
2. Add basic error telemetry if possible
3. Test thoroughly on dev devices first
4. Have a rollback plan ready
5. Monitor the rollout carefully

The architecture handles the critical requirements:
- ✓ Reliable deployment mechanism
- ✓ Self-update capability
- ✓ Recovery mechanisms
- ✓ No concurrent downloads
- ✓ Backup strategy

Biggest risk: The Activity-based architecture of current OTA updater, but we've documented this and have a plan for v3.
