# MentraOS Core Microphone System Documentation

## Overview

The MentraOS microphone system is a complex, multi-layered architecture that handles audio input from both phone microphones and smart glasses' onboard microphones. The system is designed to dynamically switch between different microphone sources based on device capabilities, user preferences, and system conflicts.

## Key Problems and Issues

### 1. Naming Confusion
- `getForceCoreOnboardMic()` is misleadingly named - it doesn't force anything, it's just a preference
- "Core onboard mic" actually means "phone mic" not glasses mic
- The preference system is inconsistent with actual behavior

### 2. Multiple Decision Points
- Microphone selection happens in multiple places with different logic:
  - SmartGlassesManager.applyMicrophoneState()
  - SmartGlassesRepresentative (PhoneMicrophoneManager setup)
  - PhoneMicrophoneManager (internal mode switching)
- This creates spaghetti code where it's unclear which system is in control

### 3. Incomplete State Management
- When switching to glasses mic due to conflicts, the system doesn't reliably switch back
- State transitions are not properly managed between different components
- Multiple systems can bypass each other

## Architecture Components

### 1. SmartGlassesManager
Located in: `SmartGlassesManager.java`

**Purpose**: Central manager for smart glasses functionality

**Key Methods**:
- `changeMicrophoneState(boolean enabled)`: Entry point for mic state changes with 10-second debounce for turn-off
- `applyMicrophoneState(boolean enabled)`: Actually applies the mic state change

**Decision Logic**:
```java
if (glasses.hasInMic() && !getForceCoreOnboardMic()) {
    // Use glasses microphone
    smartGlassesCommunicator.changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState(enabled);
} else {
    // Disable glasses mic if it has one
    if (glasses.hasInMic()) {
        smartGlassesCommunicator.changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState(false);
    }
    // Use phone's mic
    smartGlassesRepresentative.changeBluetoothMicState(enabled);
}
```

### 2. SmartGlassesRepresentative
Located in: `SmartGlassesRepresentative.java`

**Purpose**: Represents a connected smart glasses device and manages its communication

**PhoneMicrophoneManager Setup**:
- Only created if `getSensingEnabled()` is true
- Only created if glasses don't have mic OR `getForceCoreOnboardMic()` is true
- This means glasses with mics and no force preference won't have PhoneMicrophoneManager!

**Key Methods**:
- `changeBluetoothMicState(boolean enable)`: Delegates to PhoneMicrophoneManager
- `receiveChunk(ByteBuffer)`: Processes audio data from phone mic

### 3. PhoneMicrophoneManager
Located in: `PhoneMicrophoneManager.java`

**Purpose**: Manages dynamic switching between phone mic modes (SCO, Normal, Glasses)

**Mic Modes**:
- `SCO_MODE`: Bluetooth SCO mode (high quality, supports BT headsets)
- `NORMAL_MODE`: Normal phone mic
- `GLASSES_MIC`: Glasses onboard mic
- `PAUSED`: Recording paused

**Key Features**:
- Detects phone calls and external app mic usage
- Automatically switches to glasses mic when conflicts detected
- Manages Android foreground service for mic access
- Has debouncing to prevent rapid mode changes

**Important**: When switching to glasses mic, it only sets a preference but our fix added the actual mic enable call.

### 4. SmartGlassesCommunicator (Base Class)
Located in: `SmartGlassesCommunicator.java`

**Purpose**: Abstract base class for all device-specific communicators

**Key Method**:
- `changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState(boolean enabled)`: Virtual method implemented by each device

### 5. EvenRealitiesG1SGC
Located in: `EvenRealitiesG1SGC.java`

**Purpose**: Communicator for Even Realities G1 glasses

**Mic Control**:
- `changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState()`: Sends actual BLE commands to enable/disable mic
- Uses `setMicEnabled()` to send `0E 01` (enable) or `0E 00` (disable) commands
- Uses `micBeat` to keep the mic active

### 6. SpeechRecSwitchSystem
Located in: `SpeechRecSwitchSystem.java`

**Purpose**: Routes audio data to speech recognition

**Key Features**:
- Implements AudioProcessingCallback
- Tracks microphone state
- Routes PCM and LC3 audio to ASR framework

## Audio Flow Paths

### Path 1: Phone Microphone (SCO/Normal Mode)
1. PhoneMicrophoneManager creates MicrophoneLocalAndBluetooth
2. Audio chunks flow to PhoneMicrophoneManager.audioChunkCallback
3. Callback forwards to SmartGlassesRepresentative.receiveChunk()
4. receiveChunk() converts PCM to LC3 and calls audioProcessingCallback
5. SpeechRecSwitchSystem receives audio via callback interface

### Path 2: Glasses Microphone
1. SmartGlassesCommunicator receives audio from glasses via BLE
2. Audio is already in LC3 format from glasses
3. Communicator calls audioProcessingCallback.onLC3AudioDataAvailable()
4. SpeechRecSwitchSystem receives LC3 audio directly

## Current Issues in Detail

### Issue 1: Incomplete Glasses Mic Switching
**Problem**: When PhoneMicrophoneManager.switchToGlassesMic() is called, it doesn't actually enable the glasses mic

**Original Code**:
```java
public void switchToGlassesMic() {
    // Only sets preference, doesn't enable mic!
    SmartGlassesManager.setForceCoreOnboardMic(context, false);
    currentStatus = MicStatus.GLASSES_MIC;
    notifyStatusChange();
}
```

**Fix Applied**:
```java
// Actually enable the glasses microphone
if (glassesRep != null && glassesRep.smartGlassesCommunicator != null) {
    glassesRep.smartGlassesCommunicator.changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState(true);
}
```

### Issue 2: Missing Cleanup When Leaving Glasses Mic Mode
**Problem**: When switching from glasses mic back to phone mic, the glasses mic wasn't disabled

**Fix Applied**: Added cleanup code in switchToScoMode() and switchToNormalMode()

### Issue 3: Audio Not Flowing from Glasses
**Current Investigation**: Even though mic commands are sent and acknowledged, no audio data flows from glasses

**Possible Causes**:
1. Audio data handler not properly set up for glasses
2. MicBeat not keeping mic active
3. BLE communication issue
4. Audio format mismatch

### Issue 4: Unreliable Return to Phone Mic
**Problem**: After external app releases mic, system doesn't reliably return to phone mic

**Root Cause**: Multiple decision points and state management issues

## Recommendations for Refactoring

### 1. Centralize Mic Decision Logic
- Create a single MicrophoneManager that owns all mic state
- Remove distributed decision making
- Clear hierarchy: User Preference → System Conflicts → Device Capabilities

### 2. Rename Confusing Terms
- `getForceCoreOnboardMic()` → `getPreferPhoneMic()`
- "Core onboard mic" → "Phone microphone"
- Make naming consistent throughout

### 3. Proper State Machine
- Implement proper state transitions
- Ensure cleanup happens on every transition
- Single source of truth for current mic state

### 4. Unified Audio Pipeline
- Single audio callback interface
- Consistent handling regardless of source
- Remove bypasses and special cases

### 5. Fix PhoneMicrophoneManager Lifecycle
- Should always exist if sensing is enabled
- Should handle all mic sources, not just phone
- Should be the single point of control

## Debugging Commands

To trace mic state:
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "PhoneMicrophoneManager|SmartGlassesManager|EvenRealitiesG1SGC|changeMicrophoneState|changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState|MIC"
```

Key log tags:
- `WearableAi_PhoneMicrophoneManager`: Phone mic manager decisions
- `WearableAi_EvenRealitiesG1SGC`: Glasses mic commands
- `SGM_Manager`: SmartGlassesManager decisions
- `WearableAi_ASGRepresentative`: Representative setup

## MIC SYSTEM REFACTOR

### Design Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: PhoneMicrophoneManager becomes the sole authority for all microphone decisions
2. **Always Present**: PhoneMicrophoneManager exists whenever sensing is enabled
3. **Simple Interface**: Other components only say "mic on/off", not which mic or how
4. **Intelligent Fallback**: Respects preferences but adapts to system constraints

### Refactoring Plan

#### Phase 1: Rename and Clarify

1. **Rename Misleading Methods**:
   ```java
   // Old → New
   getForceCoreOnboardMic() → getPreferPhoneMic()
   setForceCoreOnboardMic() → setPreferPhoneMic()
   changeBluetoothMicState() → setMicrophoneEnabled()
   ```

2. **Update String Resources**:
   - `R.string.FORCE_CORE_ONBOARD_MIC` → `R.string.PREFER_PHONE_MIC`
   - Update all UI strings to say "Phone Microphone" instead of "Core Onboard Mic"

#### Phase 2: Centralize Control

1. **Rename PhoneMicrophoneManager → UnifiedMicrophoneManager**
   - Better reflects its new role managing ALL microphones

2. **Always Create UnifiedMicrophoneManager**:
   ```java
   // In SmartGlassesRepresentative.connectToSmartGlasses()
   if (SmartGlassesManager.getSensingEnabled(context)) {
       // ALWAYS create the microphone manager
       if (microphoneManager == null) {
           microphoneManager = new UnifiedMicrophoneManager(
               context,
               audioProcessingCallback,
               this,
               this
           );
       }
       // Let it decide which mic to use based on preferences
       microphoneManager.initialize();
   }
   ```

3. **Remove Mic Logic from SmartGlassesManager**:
   ```java
   // Old complex logic in SmartGlassesManager
   public void changeMicrophoneState(boolean enabled) {
       // Remove all the debouncing and decision logic
       // Just delegate to the representative
       if (smartGlassesRepresentative != null) {
           smartGlassesRepresentative.setMicrophoneEnabled(enabled);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Simplify SmartGlassesRepresentative**:
   ```java
   public void setMicrophoneEnabled(boolean enabled) {
       if (microphoneManager != null) {
           microphoneManager.setMicrophoneEnabled(enabled);
       }
   }
   ```

#### Phase 3: Enhance UnifiedMicrophoneManager

1. **Add Preference-Based Logic**:
   ```java
   public class UnifiedMicrophoneManager {
       // Add explicit preference handling
       private MicPreference userPreference;

       public enum MicPreference {
           PHONE_MIC,      // User prefers phone mic
           GLASSES_MIC,    // User prefers glasses mic
           AUTO            // System decides based on quality/availability
       }

       public void initialize() {
           // Read user preference
           userPreference = readUserPreference();

           // Start with preferred mic if available
           if (userPreference == MicPreference.GLASSES_MIC && glassesHaveMic()) {
               switchToGlassesMic();
           } else {
               startPreferredMicMode(); // Try SCO first
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Direct Control of All Mics**:
   ```java
   public void switchToGlassesMic() {
       // Clean up phone mic
       cleanUpCurrentMic();
       stopMicrophoneService();

       // Enable glasses mic directly
       if (glassesRep != null && glassesRep.smartGlassesCommunicator != null) {
           glassesRep.smartGlassesCommunicator.changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState(true);
           currentStatus = MicStatus.GLASSES_MIC;
           notifyStatusChange();
       } else {
           // Fallback if glasses not available
           pauseRecording();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Unified setMicrophoneEnabled**:
   ```java
   public void setMicrophoneEnabled(boolean enabled) {
       if (enabled) {
           // Determine best mic based on:
           // 1. User preference
           // 2. System constraints (phone calls, external apps)
           // 3. Device availability

           if (shouldUseGlassesMic()) {
               switchToGlassesMic();
           } else if (canUseScoMode()) {
               switchToScoMode();
           } else {
               switchToNormalMode();
           }
       } else {
           // Disable all mics
           pauseRecording();
           if (currentStatus == MicStatus.GLASSES_MIC) {
               glassesRep.smartGlassesCommunicator.changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState(false);
           }
       }
   }

   private boolean shouldUseGlassesMic() {
       // Use glasses mic if:
       // - User prefers it AND glasses have mic
       // - OR phone mic unavailable AND glasses have mic
       return (userPreference == MicPreference.GLASSES_MIC && glassesHaveMic()) ||
              (isExternalAudioActive && glassesHaveMic());
   }
   ```

#### Phase 4: Remove Distributed Logic

1. **Remove from SmartGlassesManager**:
   - Delete `applyMicrophoneState()` method
   - Delete mic debouncing logic
   - Delete direct calls to `changeSmartGlassesMicrophoneState()`

2. **Update All Call Sites**:
   ```java
   // Anywhere in the codebase that needs mic control:
   // Old: smartGlassesManager.changeMicrophoneState(true)
   // New: smartGlassesManager.setMicrophoneEnabled(true)

   // The manager just passes through to the UnifiedMicrophoneManager
   ```

3. **Ensure Speech Recognition Integration**:
   ```java
   // UnifiedMicrophoneManager notifies speech rec of ALL mic changes
   private void notifyStatusChange() {
       EventBus.getDefault().post(new MicModeChangedEvent(currentStatus));

       // Also notify speech rec system
       if (speechRecSystem != null) {
           boolean micEnabled = (currentStatus != MicStatus.PAUSED);
           speechRecSystem.microphoneStateChanged(micEnabled);
       }
   }
   ```

#### Phase 5: Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test preference fallback logic
   - Test conflict detection and resolution
   - Test state transitions

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test GBoard takeover and release
   - Test phone call interruption
   - Test glasses connection/disconnection
   - Test preference changes

3. **Manual Test Scenarios**:
   - User prefers phone mic → GBoard takes over → switches to glasses → GBoard releases → returns to phone
   - User prefers glasses mic → works normally → glasses disconnect → falls back to phone
   - Phone call during recording → appropriate mic switching

### Benefits of This Refactor

1. **Simplicity**: One place to look for mic logic
2. **Reliability**: Consistent state management
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new mic sources or preferences
4. **Maintainability**: Clear ownership and responsibilities
5. **Debuggability**: Single component to monitor

### Migration Strategy

1. **Step 1**: Rename methods and preferences (backward compatible)
2. **Step 2**: Always create PhoneMicrophoneManager
3. **Step 3**: Move logic incrementally from SmartGlassesManager
4. **Step 4**: Test each change thoroughly
5. **Step 5**: Remove old code once new system is stable

## Summary

The microphone system suffers from:
1. Distributed decision making across multiple components
2. Incomplete state transitions
3. Confusing naming conventions
4. Missing implementation (glasses mic not actually enabled when switching)
5. Inconsistent lifecycle management

The refactor plan centralizes all microphone management into a renamed UnifiedMicrophoneManager that:
- Always exists when sensing is enabled
- Is the single source of truth for mic state
- Handles all mic sources (phone SCO, phone normal, glasses)
- Respects user preferences while adapting to system constraints
- Provides a simple on/off interface to the rest of the system

## NEW ISSUE: Rapid Server Commands Being Ignored

### Problem Description
When starting an app that uses the microphone, the server sends rapid commands:
1. `microphone_state_change: false` (turn off mic)
2. `microphone_state_change: true` (turn on mic)

These come within milliseconds of each other. The current debouncing logic simply ignores any request within 2 seconds of the last change, causing the mic to stay off when it should turn on.

### Log Evidence
```
19:47:19.591 Changing microphone state to false
19:47:19.722 Changing microphone state to true
19:47:19.722 Ignoring mode change request - too soon after previous change
```

### Root Cause
The debouncing in `PhoneMicrophoneManager.startPreferredMicMode()` is too simplistic:
```java
if (now - lastModeChangeTime < MODE_CHANGE_DEBOUNCE_MS) {
    Log.d(TAG, "Ignoring mode change request - too soon after previous change");
    return;
}
```

### Solution: Smart Debouncing
Instead of ignoring rapid changes, we should:

1. **Check for actual state changes**: If mic is off and server says "turn off" then "turn on", the second command is a real state change and shouldn't be ignored

2. **Queue the last request**: For truly rapid oscillations (off→on→off→on), execute the final state after a delay

3. **Reduce debounce time**: 2 seconds is too long; 500ms should be sufficient

### Implementation Plan

1. Track requested state vs actual state
2. If requested state differs from current state, allow immediate execution
3. If rapid same-state requests, ignore duplicates
4. For rapid oscillating requests, queue the last one with a delay

### Code Changes Needed

In `PhoneMicrophoneManager`:
- Add `pendingStatus` and `pendingModeChangeRunnable` fields
- Modify `startPreferredMicMode()` to implement smart debouncing
- Check if the requested state actually differs from current state
- Queue final state for delayed execution if needed

### Implementation Complete (✓)

Changes made to `PhoneMicrophoneManager`:

1. **Reduced debounce time** from 2000ms to 500ms
2. **Added smart debouncing fields**:
   - `pendingMicRequest`: tracks if there's a pending request
   - `pendingModeChangeRunnable`: holds delayed execution

3. **Updated `startPreferredMicMode()`**:
   - Checks current state vs requested state
   - If mic is PAUSED and we get enable request → execute immediately
   - If mic is enabled and we get duplicate enable → skip it
   - If rapid changes while enabled → queue for later execution
   - Cancels any pending requests when new one arrives

4. **Updated `pauseRecording()`**:
   - Similar smart logic for disable requests
   - If already paused → skip duplicate
   - If enabled → pause immediately (no delay for safety)
   - Cancels any pending enable requests

5. **Added helper methods**:
   - `executeMicEnable()`: actual enable logic
   - `executePause()`: actual pause logic with glasses mic cleanup

The system now handles rapid server commands intelligently:
- Off→On transitions execute immediately (real state change)
- Duplicate requests are ignored
- Rapid oscillations queue the final state
- Pause requests execute immediately for safety

## PROGRESS

### Completed Changes

#### 1. Always Create PhoneMicrophoneManager (✓)
- Modified `SmartGlassesRepresentative.connectToSmartGlasses()` to ALWAYS create PhoneMicrophoneManager when sensing is enabled
- Removed conditional logic that only created it for certain configurations
- Now serves as the unified microphone manager for all mic types

#### 2. Simplified SmartGlassesManager (✓)
- Removed complex `applyMicrophoneState()` method entirely
- Removed 10-second debounce logic and associated fields/handlers
- Simplified `changeMicrophoneState()` to just delegate to SmartGlassesRepresentative
- Removed distributed decision making - SmartGlassesManager no longer decides which mic to use

#### 3. Enhanced PhoneMicrophoneManager (✓)
- Updated `startPreferredMicMode()` to check user preferences and device capabilities
- Now properly switches to glasses mic if user prefers it and glasses have mic
- Added proper speech recognition notification when switching to glasses mic
- Fixed return logic when external apps release mic - now properly returns from glasses mic to preferred mode

#### 4. Fixed State Transitions (✓)
- When switching from glasses mic back to phone mic after GBoard releases, now properly:
  - Disables glasses mic first
  - Returns to user's preferred mode
  - Handles all edge cases (phone calls, external apps, etc.)

### Key Improvements

1. **Single Decision Point**: PhoneMicrophoneManager now makes ALL microphone decisions
2. **Always Present**: PhoneMicrophoneManager exists whenever sensing is enabled
3. **Proper Cleanup**: Glasses mic is properly disabled when switching away
4. **Reliable Return**: System now reliably returns to preferred mic after conflicts resolve
5. **Simplified Interface**: Other components just say "mic on/off"

### Remaining Work

1. **Rename Methods** (skipped per request):
   - `getForceCoreOnboardMic()` → `getPreferPhoneMic()`
   - `changeBluetoothMicState()` → `setMicrophoneEnabled()`

2. **Testing Required**:
   - Test GBoard takeover and release with both phone and glasses mic preferences
   - Test phone call interruption scenarios
   - Test glasses connection/disconnection during recording
   - Verify audio flows correctly from both sources

### Test Scenarios to Verify

1. **User prefers phone mic**:
   - Start recording → GBoard takes over → switches to glasses mic → GBoard releases → returns to phone mic ✓

2. **User prefers glasses mic**:
   - Start recording with glasses mic → GBoard takes over → stays on glasses mic → GBoard releases → stays on glasses mic ✓

3. **Edge cases**:
   - Glasses disconnect while using glasses mic → falls back to phone mic
   - Phone call during recording → appropriate switching
   - Multiple rapid app switches → no feedback loops
