# ASG Camera Rapid Photo Capture Fix Plan

## Executive Summary

The ASG client camera system fails when users rapidly press the photo button (faster than 1 photo/second), causing camera disconnection errors and missed photos. This plan outlines a comprehensive fix to enable true rapid-fire photo capture at 3-4 photos per second.

## Current Problem

### User Experience

When a user rapidly presses the camera button on the K900 smart glasses:

- First photo: Sometimes works, sometimes fails with "Camera disconnected"
- Subsequent rapid photos: Mostly fail with camera errors
- Success rate: ~30-50% of photos actually captured
- Error recovery: Takes 1-2 seconds before camera works again

### Technical Issues Identified

#### 1. Multiple Service Instance Creation

```
17:28:23.592 - CameraNeo Camera2 service created (Instance #1)
17:28:24.633 - CameraNeo Camera2 service created (Instance #2)
17:28:24.641 - CameraNeo Camera2 service created (Instance #3)
```

- Multiple CameraNeo service instances are created for rapid button presses
- Each instance tries to open the camera hardware
- Android camera HAL doesn't support multiple concurrent open attempts

#### 2. Camera Hardware Conflicts

```
CameraAccessException: CAMERA_ERROR (3): cancelRequest:459:
Camera 0: Error clearing streaming request: Function not implemented (-38)
```

- When Service #2 tries to open camera, it forces Service #1's camera to disconnect
- Service #1 fails with "Camera disconnected" error
- This cascades through all service instances

#### 3. Race Condition in Service Reuse Logic

Current check in `takePictureWithCallback`:

```java
if (sInstance != null && sInstance.isCameraKeptAlive && sInstance.cameraDevice != null) {
    // Reuse existing service
} else {
    // Create new service
}
```

Timeline of the race condition:

- 0ms: Button press #1 → startForegroundService()
- 50ms: Service onCreate() starts
- 100ms: sInstance = this (but camera not open yet)
- 200ms: Button press #2 arrives
- 200ms: Check fails (isCameraKeptAlive=false, cameraDevice=null)
- 201ms: Another service created → Conflict!
- 400ms: Camera finally opens for Service #1
- 401ms: Service #2 forces Service #1 to disconnect

#### 4. Dead Thread Handler Errors

```
Handler (android.os.Handler) {54ce50} sending message to a Handler on a dead thread
```

- Background handler threads are terminated while operations are pending
- Happens when services are destroyed rapidly

#### 5. Photo Request Queue Issues

- Current queue implementation only works AFTER camera is initialized
- Requests during initialization period (~600ms) create new services
- No queue at the MediaCaptureService level

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause

The fundamental issue is that **service creation is not properly synchronized**. The static instance check happens too late in the initialization cycle, allowing multiple services to be created during the camera initialization window.

### Contributing Factors

1. **Initialization Window**: Camera takes ~600ms to fully initialize
2. **Incomplete State Checks**: Only checking if camera is "kept alive", not if service exists
3. **No Request Queuing**: During initialization, requests create new services instead of queuing
4. **Hardware Limitations**: K900 camera HAL can't handle concurrent access attempts

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture Changes

#### 1. True Singleton Pattern with Static State Management

```java
public class CameraNeo extends Service {
    // Static state flags - set IMMEDIATELY
    private static volatile boolean isServiceStarting = false;
    private static volatile boolean isServiceRunning = false;
    private static final Object SERVICE_LOCK = new Object();

    // Global request queue - survives service restarts
    private static final Queue<PhotoRequest> globalRequestQueue = new LinkedList<>();

    // Callback registry - maintains callbacks across requests
    private static final Map<String, PhotoCaptureCallback> callbackRegistry = new HashMap<>();
}
```

#### 2. Three-Stage Service State Model

1. **STARTING** - Service created but camera not initialized
2. **RUNNING** - Camera initialized and ready
3. **IDLE** - No service exists

#### 3. Request Flow Redesign

##### Stage 1: Request Entry (MediaCaptureService)

```java
public void takePhotoLocally(String size, boolean enableLed) {
    // Create request
    PhotoRequest request = new PhotoRequest(filePath, size, enableLed, callback);

    // Delegate to CameraNeo singleton
    CameraNeo.enqueuePhotoRequest(context, request);
}
```

##### Stage 2: Smart Queuing (CameraNeo.enqueuePhotoRequest)

```java
public static void enqueuePhotoRequest(Context context, PhotoRequest request) {
    synchronized (SERVICE_LOCK) {
        if (isServiceRunning && cameraReady) {
            // Fast path - camera ready
            processRequestImmediately(request);
        } else {
            // Queue request
            globalRequestQueue.offer(request);

            // Start service if needed
            if (!isServiceStarting && !isServiceRunning) {
                isServiceStarting = true;
                context.startForegroundService(new Intent(context, CameraNeo.class));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### Stage 3: Queue Processing

```java
private void onCameraReady() {
    synchronized (SERVICE_LOCK) {
        cameraReady = true;
        processAllQueuedRequests();
    }
}

private void processAllQueuedRequests() {
    while (!globalRequestQueue.isEmpty()) {
        PhotoRequest request = globalRequestQueue.poll();
        capturePhotoWithOpenCamera(request);
        // Small delay between shots to prevent buffer overflow
        SystemClock.sleep(100);
    }
}
```

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Service Singleton Implementation

1. Add static state management to CameraNeo
2. Implement SERVICE_LOCK synchronization
3. Create global request queue
4. Update onCreate/onDestroy to manage static state

#### Phase 2: Request Queue System

1. Create PhotoRequest class with all needed parameters
2. Implement global queue that survives service lifecycle
3. Add callback registry for maintaining callbacks
4. Implement queue processing after camera ready

#### Phase 3: MediaCaptureService Integration

1. Remove direct startService calls
2. Use CameraNeo.enqueuePhotoRequest() instead
3. Ensure callbacks are properly registered

#### Phase 4: Camera Session Optimization

1. Implement proper keep-alive timer management
2. Ensure session reuse for queued requests
3. Add minimum interval between captures (100-200ms)

#### Phase 5: Error Recovery

1. Add retry logic for camera disconnect errors
2. Implement exponential backoff for retries
3. Clear queue on permanent failures

### Code Changes Required

#### Files to Modify

### Testing Plan

#### Test Scenarios

1. **Single Photo**: Verify normal photo capture still works
2. **Rapid 5 Photos**: Press button 5 times in 2 seconds
3. **Extreme Rapid**: Press button 10 times in 3 seconds
4. **Mixed Timing**: Combination of rapid and slow presses
5. **Error Recovery**: Force camera error and verify recovery

#### Expected Results

- **Capture Rate**: 3-4 photos per second after initialization
- **Success Rate**: >95% of requested photos captured
- **Initialization**: First photo takes ~600ms, subsequent <300ms
- **Queue Processing**: All queued photos captured in order
- **No Errors**: Zero "Camera disconnected" errors during rapid capture

### Performance Metrics

#### Current Performance

- Success rate: 30-50%
- Max capture rate: 1 photo/second
- Error rate: 50-70% during rapid capture
- Recovery time: 1-2 seconds after error

#### Target Performance

- Success rate: >95%
- Max capture rate: 3-4 photos/second
- Error rate: <5%
- Recovery time: <500ms

### Risk Mitigation

#### Potential Risks

1. **Memory Pressure**: Queue could grow unbounded
   - Mitigation: Limit queue size to 20 photos
2. **Battery Drain**: Rapid photos consume power
   - Mitigation: Add configurable rate limiting
3. **Storage Space**: Many photos fill storage quickly
   - Mitigation: Add storage check before capture
4. **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access to static fields
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive synchronization with SERVICE_LOCK
